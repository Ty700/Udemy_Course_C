Char I/O Functions 

Char Functions 
    - getc
    - getchar
    - fgetc
    - ungetc
    - putc
    - putchar
    - fputc

    - these functions are declarfed in stdio.h

    - originally, I/O functions were not part of the definition of C 
        - their development was left to C implementations
        - the Unix implementation of C has served as a model for these functions
    
    - when a C program is executed, three files are automatically opened by the system for use by the program
        - stdin, stdout, stderr
        
        - stdin identifies the standard input of the program and is normally associated with your terminal window
            - all standard I/O fimctons that preform input and do not take a FILE pointer as an argument get their input from stdin
            
        - stdout referes to the standard output, which is normally also associated wiht your terminal window

        - stderr identifies the error file
            - where most of the error messagfes produced byh the system are written and is also normally your terminal window
