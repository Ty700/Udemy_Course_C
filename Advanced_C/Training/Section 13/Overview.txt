The Preprocessor
    - the process of creating a C program involves many different steps
        - Preprocessor
        - compilation
        - assembler
        - linker
        - loader
    
    - a progarm called the preprocessor is invoked bnefore any code gets compiled in the C programming language
        - a separate step in the compilation process
        - not part of the compiler

    - the C preprocessor is essentially a text substitution tool
        - instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation
    
    - it mainly performs three tasks on your code
        - removes all the comments
        - includes all of the files from various libraries that the program needs to compile
        - expansion of macro defintions
        
    Preprocessor Directives
        - commands used by the preprocessor are called preprocessor directives and they begin with "#" symbol
        
Conditional Compilation 
    - often used to create one program that can be compiled to run on different computer systems

    - if you had a large program that had many dependencies on specific hardware or software
        - you might end up with many defines whose values would have to be changed when the program has moved to another computer systems
        - you can help reduce this problem by incorporating the values of these defines for each different machine into the program by using the conditional compilation
            capabilities of the preprocessor
    
    - it is also used to switch on or off various statements in the program
        - debugging statements that print out the values fo various variables
        - trace the flow of program execution

    - conditional compilation enables you to control the execution of preprocessor directives and the compilation of program code
        - each of the conditional preprocessor
