User defined data type that allows a programmers to define a variable and specify the valid values that could be stored into that variable

Ex:

    Can create a variable named "myColor" and it can only contain one of the primary colors


First have to define the enum type and give it a name
    initiated by the keyword enum
    then the name of the enumerated data type
    then list of identifiers that define the permissible values that can be assigned to that type

To declare a variable to be of type enum primaryColor
    use the keyword enum
    followed byt the enum type name
    followed by var name

Coding Example:
    enum primaryColor {red, blue, yellow};

    enum primaryColor x = green; //Error - unless I add green inside the enum
    enum primaryColor y = red; //No Error

    enum primaryColor myColor, someoneElseColor; //Declared but not assigned

Another One:
    enum month {January, Feburary, March, April, May, June, July, August, Septemebter, October, Novemeber, Decemeber}

Compiler treats enums identifiers as constant ints

enum month thisMonth;

thisMonth = Feburary;
//thisMonth = month[1] essentially 

If I want the identifier's constant int to be something else I can explicitly define it:

    enum direction {up, down, left = 10, right};

    up = 0, down = 1, left = 10, right = 11 NOT 3
