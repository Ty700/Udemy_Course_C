#include <stdin>

scanf() - general function for collecting input from keyboard

%s - strings
%d - ints
%c - chars
%f - floats

printf() uses variable names, constants, and expressions in arg list

scanf() uses pointers to variables

3 Rules for scanf():
    1. Returns the number of items that it reads
    2. If you use scanf() to read a value for one of the basic variable types we've discussed, preced the var name with an '&'
    3. If you use scanf() to read a string into a char array, don't use an '&'

scanf() uses whitespace to decide how to divide the input into seperate fields

scanf() is the opposite of printf()

Ex:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int i;

    printf("Enter a value: ");

    scanf("%s %d",str, &i); //Grabs a String and an int from user

    printf("You've entered: %s %d", str, i); //Just prints it out

}

Have to input in the order that scanf() is asking for
