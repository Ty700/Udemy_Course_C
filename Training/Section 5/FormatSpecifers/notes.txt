Format specifiers are used when displaying var as output
    - specify the type of data of the variable to be displayed

int sum = 89;

printf("The sum is %d\n", sum);

    %d is the format specifier. 
        - specifies that the variable being printed is of the int data type

    Lots of other format specifers, reference a sheet on C reference. Should be same website as CPP reference
